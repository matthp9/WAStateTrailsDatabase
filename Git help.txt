Clone the repository from the UI
Open a shell in your clone

Add the remote repo as a remote, run:
“git remote add github https://github.com/matthp9/WAStateTrailsDatabase”

Create a feature branch and switch to it so we don’t step on each other’s toes:
"git checkout -b [your branch name] origin/ui”

Make your changes to the source or whatever.

Run git status. For all the files you changed, run:
“git add [path to file]” if it’s a new file
“git stage [path to file]” if you changed an existing file

After adding/staging all your changes, commit them:
git commit -m “your commit message here”
For consistency’s sake start the commit message with a lowercase letter

If you ever need to get back to this point in time, run:
“git reset --hard [commit]”
Or if you haven’t had any new commits since then, just run:
“git reset --hard”
But this will wipe out any uncommitted changes you have.

Push your commits after you’ve made them:
“git push github”
If you get a message like you don’t have a tracking branch, or that you need to set the remote upstream, that is fine, you can do so by instead running:
“git push --set-upstream github [branch name]”
This is needed for your first push only usually because you haven’t specified a branch on the remote that you want to push to.

Add some documentation to the readme for changes you make.
In the UI, we can work together to merge branches together, I can take care of that if needed.
